The International HVAC-R, Insulation, Pump, Valve, Installation, Water Treatment, Fire, Pool, and Solar Energy Systems Fair serves as a critical platform for the sector.\n\nOrganized by Deutsche Messe in collaboration with Hannover Messe Sodeks Fuarcılık and co-organizers including ISKAV, DOSİDER, İSKİD, İZODER, TTMD, POMSAD, SOSİAD, ESSİAD, MTMD, and KBSD, the fair is showcasing a comprehensive range of products within the HVAC-R, insulation, pump, valve, installation, water treatment, fire, pool, and solar energy systems categories.\n\n### Strong Growth and Global Aspirations\n\nMehmet Şanal, Chairman of the Board of the HVAC-R Industry Exporters' Association (İSİB), highlighted the sector's evolution into a significant force, driven by robust R\u0026D infrastructure and high production capacity. “Our strength in both domestic and global markets is consistently growing, a testament to the solidarity among our sector's NGOs. The widespread interest in our fair is a direct result of this collaborative spirit,” Şanal stated.\n\nHe noted that global HVAC-R imports stand at an impressive $604 billion. Despite some challenges over the past two years, Turkish HVAC-R exports have surged by 22% when viewed over the last four years. “As a sector, by working hand-in-hand, we are pursuing an export target of $7.8 billion this year. We have also defined our objectives for 2026 through discussions with our industry associations,” Şanal added.\n\nISK-SODEX 2025 is set to host B2B meetings with over 300 participants from 61 countries. Şanal specifically mentioned that a 100-person delegation from Egypt will engage in B2B discussions throughout the fair, with expectations that these interactions will generate sufficient business volume to cover firms' production capacity for four months.\n\n### A Strategic Hub for Sustainable Development\n\nMehtap Gürsoy, General Manager of Hannover Messe Sodeks Fuarcılık, emphasized ISK-SODEX's role as a global showcase for the Turkish HVAC-R sector. “ISK-SODEX has become a pivotal meeting point in our country, laying the groundwork for sustainable development and pioneering technological transformation. Over these four days, we will explore every facet of the HVAC-R industry, steering its direction with innovations and advancements,” Gürsoy explained.\n\nShe expressed confidence in elevating the sector's high potential through ISK-SODEX 2025, positioning the event as a strategic center for industry growth. “As the ISK-SODEX family, we are committed to working together for the continued expansion of the Turkish HVAC-R sector,” Gürsoy affirmed.\n\nSarven Çilingiroğlu, Chairman of the Board of the Heating, Cooling, Air Conditioning Research and Education Foundation (ISKAV), underscored the fair's importance beyond a mere exhibition. He described ISK-SODEX as a crucial platform for showcasing the Turkish HVAC-R industry's strength, engineering prowess, and production capabilities, highlighting its significant contribution to the nation's industrial capacity, technological competence, and sustainable development efforts.",
