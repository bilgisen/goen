  "content_md": "# AKLease Filo to Become \"Greenest Fleet,\" Targets 10,000 Vehicles in Five Years\n\n**ISTANBUL, Turkey** – AKLease Filo, the operational leasing arm of AKLease, which commenced operations approximately two years ago, is rapidly positioning itself as a significant player in the sector. The company recently outlined its ambitious growth strategy, aiming to expand its fleet to 10,000 vehicles within five years, with a strong focus on sustainability and digital innovation.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference detailing the company's development and strategies, AKLease General Manager Eser Okyay highlighted their rapid progress. \"Having reached a fleet of 2,500 vehicles, we have established a strong position in the sector through our reliable, digital, and customer-centric service approach,\" Okyay stated. \"As AKLease Filo, growing under the umbrella of Sabancı Holding, one of Turkey's most established conglomerates, and bolstered by Akbank's financial strength, we aim to increase our fleet to 10,000 vehicles within five years. In addition to our long-term leasing solutions, we plan to offer short-term rentals and digital mobility models in the near future.\"\n\nOkyay also touched upon the broader leasing market, noting that despite a slowdown in the industrial sector, the leasing of business and construction machinery accounts for approximately 30-31% of the industry, indicating robust demand in this segment.\n\n## Financial Strength Fuels Competitive Edge and Sustainable Growth\n\nOğuzhan Avdan, Deputy General Manager of AKLease Filo, emphasized the company's rapid establishment as a trusted business partner for both corporate and SME segments. \"As an affiliate of Aklease, we benefit from a competitive advantage in pricing,\" Avdan explained. \"Currently, we do not engage in vehicle sales. Our focus is on organic growth, aiming to expand our existing fleet by 2027.\"\n\nAKLease Filo is committed to building the \"greenest fleet\" by integrating new and up-to-date vehicles. Avdan clarified their strategic approach: \"We are not rushing to reach 20-30 thousand vehicles like some market players. Instead, we carefully position our fleet by analyzing the evolving trends in mobility and electrification. The second-hand sales values of vehicles are critically important for profitability, which is why we view inorganic growth and sudden model changes as risky.\"\n\nThe company actively offers electric vehicles (EVs) to its clients. However, Avdan noted that businesses are approaching EVs cautiously due to rapidly changing technology and the potential risk of sudden drops in second-hand values. AKLease Filo, in turn, incorporates these risks into its pricing strategy.\n\n\"We continue our technological investments while implementing cost-effective and long-term solutions,\" Avdan added. \"The key elements that differentiate us in the sector are our customer-centric service approach, our investments in digitalization, and our sustainability-based business model. We are not just a vehicle leasing company; we are our customers' reliable business partner in the world of mobility.\"\n\nAKLease Filo's strategy underscores a commitment to sustainable growth, digital transformation, and meeting the evolving mobility needs of businesses in Turkey.",
