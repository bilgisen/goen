The measures include a substantial increase in the daily rediscount loan limit and a reduction in interest rates, signaling a robust commitment to supporting the nation's export sector.\n\nIn a statement shared on his social media accounts, Minister Bolat declared, \"New regulations have been implemented regarding rediscount loans to enhance our exporters' access to finance and reduce their costs. The daily rediscount loan limit for exporters has been increased, and the cost of export rediscount loans has been reduced. As the Ministry of Trade, our intense efforts to support exporters and expand their access to finance are being diligently pursued in coordination with all relevant state institutions and organizations.\"\n\n## Rediscount Loan Interest Costs Drop to 24.89%\n\nMinister Bolat underscored the gradual increase in the volume of rediscount loans available to exporters. He explained that rediscount loans, provided by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) through Türk Eximbank and other commercial banks, serve as a critical tool for meeting exporters' financing needs.\n\n\"As is known, a new formula for calculating rediscount loan interest rates was established in a previous period, ensuring these loans are offered at advantageous rates below the Central Bank's policy interest rate,\" Bolat stated. \"Following the latest policy rate cut on October 23, 2025, the interest cost of export rediscount loans has now been reduced to 24.89%. Furthermore, to ensure these highly effective financing tools reach a broader base of exporters, the loan volume has been progressively increased in line with evolving needs.\"\n\n## Daily Limit Soars to TL 4.5 Billion\n\nThe Minister highlighted the remarkable progression of the daily rediscount loan limit, reaffirming the government's steadfast commitment to fostering exporter development. \"The daily limit for rediscount loans, which was previously TL 300 million, was initially raised to TL 1.5 billion, then to TL 3 billion, and subsequently to TL 4 billion,\" Bolat detailed.\n\n\"Most recently, within the framework of regulations enacted by the CBRT on October 24, 2025, this limit has been further increased to a daily TL 4.5 billion, effective from November 1, 2025,\" he added. Bolat also emphasized a strategic priority: \"Directing a significant portion of this amount towards labor-intensive sectors will contribute to their export competitiveness, which remains one of our key objectives.\"\n\nMinister Bolat concluded by affirming, \"We will resolutely continue to support the development of our exporters, particularly through the diversification of financing opportunities, and to implement policies and practices that will enhance the competitiveness of our companies in international markets.\"",
