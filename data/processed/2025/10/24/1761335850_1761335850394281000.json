  "content_md": "# Turkish Exporters Receive Significant Boost: Rediscount Loan Limit Increased, Costs Reduced\n\n**ANKARA, Turkey** – Turkish Trade Minister Ömer Bolat has announced a series of new regulations designed to significantly enhance access to finance and reduce costs for the nation's exporters. The key reforms include a substantial increase in the daily rediscount loan limit and a reduction in the associated interest costs.\n\nIn a statement shared on his social media account, Minister Bolat affirmed, \"New regulations have been implemented for rediscount loans to increase our exporters' access to financing and reduce their costs. The daily rediscount loan limit for exporters has been increased, and the cost of export rediscount loans has been lowered.\" He added that the Ministry of Trade, in coordination with all relevant state institutions, is actively working to support exporters and broaden their financing opportunities.\n\n## Interest Costs Plummet to 24.89%\n\nBolat highlighted the critical role of rediscount loans, provided by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB) through Türk Eximbank and other commercial banks, as one of the most effective tools to meet exporters' financing needs. He explained that a new formula for calculating rediscount loan interest rates, introduced previously, ensures these loans are offered at advantageous rates below the Central Bank's policy rate.\n\n\"Following the recent policy rate cut on October 23, 2025, the interest cost for export rediscount loans has fallen to 24.89%,\" Bolat stated. He further emphasized that the volume of rediscount loans has been gradually increased to reach more exporters, in line with demand.\n\n## Daily Limit Jumps to TL 4.5 Billion\n\nUnderlining the government's commitment to supporting the growth of exporters, Minister Bolat detailed the impressive increase in the daily rediscount loan limit. \"Previously at TL 300 million, the daily limit for rediscount loans was first raised to TL 1.5 billion, then to TL 3 billion, and subsequently to TL 4 billion,\" he said.\n\n The most recent adjustment, stemming from regulations by the TCMB on October 24, 2025, will see the limit further increased to a daily TL 4.5 billion, effective November 1, 2025.\n\nBolat also revealed a strategic allocation for the expanded funds: \"Furthermore, a significant portion of this amount will be utilized by labor-intensive sectors, which is one of our priorities, to contribute to their export competitiveness.\"\n\nThe Minister concluded by reiterating the government's steadfast resolve to continue supporting the development of exporters, diversifying financing options, and implementing policies and practices that enhance the international competitiveness of Turkish firms.\n",
