These measures, shared via the Minister's social media, underscore the government's ongoing commitment to strengthening Turkey's export capabilities and global competitiveness.\n\n\"New regulations have been implemented for rediscount credits within the scope of increasing the financing access opportunities and reducing the costs for our exporters,\" Minister Bolat stated. \"The daily rediscount credit limit for exporters has been increased. The cost of export rediscount credits has been reduced. As the Ministry of Trade, our efforts to support our exporters and expand their access to finance are intensely pursued in coordination with all relevant institutions and organizations of our state.\"\n\n## Daily Limit Skyrockets to ₺4.5 Billion\n\nThe most prominent change is the substantial increase in the daily rediscount credit limit. Minister Bolat highlighted a progressive upward revision:\n\n*   Initially, the daily limit stood at ₺300 million.\n*   It was subsequently raised to ₺1.5 billion, then to ₺3 billion, and most recently to ₺4 billion.\n*   Following new regulations by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB) on October 24, 2025, the daily limit will reach an unprecedented **₺4.5 billion**, effective from November 1, 2025.\n\nMinister Bolat emphasized that a significant portion of this increased allocation would be directed towards labor-intensive sectors, aiming to further boost their export competitiveness and contribution to the national economy.\n\n## Rediscount Credit Costs Plunge to 24.89%\n\nIn addition to the expanded limits, exporters will benefit from a notable reduction in financing costs. Bolat explained that the interest cost for export rediscount credits has dropped to **24.89%**.\n\nThis reduction follows a policy rate cut implemented by the Central Bank on October 23, 2025. The favorable rates are a result of a new formula for calculating rediscount credit interest rates, ensuring they are offered at advantageous terms below the Central Bank's policy rate.\n\n\"As is known, one of the most effective tools for meeting the financing needs of our exporters is rediscount credits offered by the TCMB through Türk Eximbank and other banks,\" Bolat remarked, adding that the volume of these credits has been gradually increased to meet growing exporter demands.\n\n## Government's Unwavering Commitment to Exporters\n\nMinister Bolat reaffirmed the government's unwavering commitment to supporting exporters' development and enhancing their global competitiveness.\n\n\"We will resolutely continue to support the development of our exporters, diversifying financing opportunities, and implementing policies and practices that will increase the competitiveness of our firms in international markets,\" he concluded, signaling a sustained focus on fostering a robust export-driven economy.",
