The daily rediscount credit limit has been substantially increased, and interest rates have been lowered, signaling a robust commitment to bolstering export capabilities.\n\nMinister Bolat shared the news via his social media account, stating, \"New regulations have been implemented for rediscount credits to increase financing opportunities and reduce costs for our exporters. The daily rediscount credit limit for exporters has been raised, and the cost of export rediscount credits has been lowered. As the Ministry of Trade, our efforts to support exporters and expand their access to finance are intensely pursued in coordination with all relevant institutions and organizations of our state.\"\n\n## Rediscount Credit Interest Cost Falls to 24.89%\n\nBolat underscored the gradual increase in the volume of rediscount credits available to exporters. He explained, \"As is known, one of the most effective tools for meeting our exporters' financing needs is the rediscount credits offered by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) through Türk Eximbank and other banks. A new formula was previously determined for calculating rediscount credit interest rates, ensuring these credits are offered at advantageous rates below the Central Bank's policy rate.\" \n\nHe further elaborated, \"Subsequently, following the policy rate reduction on October 23, 2025, the interest cost of export rediscount credits has been lowered to 24.89%.\" Bolat added that the credit volume has been incrementally increased to ensure more exporters can access this vital financing tool, meeting their evolving needs.\n\n## Daily Rediscount Credit Limit Boosted to 4.5 Billion TL\n\nEmphasizing their unwavering support for the development of exporters, Minister Bolat detailed the progressive increase of the daily credit limit. \"The daily limit for rediscount credits, which was previously 300 million TL, was first raised to 1.5 billion TL, then to 3 billion TL, and subsequently to 4 billion TL,\" he stated.\n\n\"Most recently, within the framework of regulations made by the CBRT on October 24, 2025, this limit has been increased to a daily 4.5 billion TL, effective from November 1, 2025.\" The Minister also highlighted a strategic priority: \"Furthermore, contributing to the export competitiveness of our labor-intensive sectors by allocating a significant portion of this amount to them will be one of our priorities.\"\n\nBolat concluded by reaffirming the government's dedication: \"Accordingly, we are resolutely committed to continuing to support the development of our exporters, particularly through diversifying financing opportunities, and implementing policies and practices that will enhance the competitiveness of our firms in international markets.\"",
