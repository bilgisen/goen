  "content_md": "A comprehensive legislative proposal, including new tax regulations, has begun discussions in the Turkish Grand National Assembly's Plan and Budget Commission. The 36-article bill's impact analysis report reveals plans for significant changes across various income streams.\n\nThe proposed amendments aim to narrow rental income exemptions, introduce notary fees for vehicle sales, impose annual payments for licenses, and increase social security contribution rates. While a symbolic decrease of only 4 million Turkish Lira (TRY) in budget revenues is projected, the bill is expected to contribute a net of 48.376 billion TRY to the budget over three years.\n\n### Number of Taxpayers to Decrease\n\nAccording to the impact analysis, the number of taxpayers benefiting from exemptions will significantly decrease. Currently, rental income up to 47,000 TRY is exempt from tax. The new regulation will restrict this exemption solely to recipients of retirement, disability, widow's, and orphan's pensions. This change is projected to generate an additional 22 billion TRY in budget revenue by 2027.\n\nAnother major alteration is the elimination of the deduction for credit interest paid on rented properties, a practice being removed due to concerns about tax fairness. This measure is expected to generate 1.6 billion TRY in revenue in 2026. Furthermore, the tax loss penalty for under-declared real estate sales will increase from 25% to 100%, an action anticipated to deter undeclared transactions.\n\n### Vehicle Sales to Incur Fees, Presidential Authority for BES\n\nThe second largest revenue generator for the budget will be a new fee on vehicle sales. This regulation will levy a fee, based on the sales price, for all new and used vehicle transactions conducted via notaries. For 2026, this measure is projected to generate 13.1 billion TRY.\n\nThe impact analysis also indicates that businesses in sectors such as jewelry, second-hand vehicle and real estate trade, and private health institutions will pay an annual license fee, expected to contribute approximately 4.5 billion TRY to the budget.\n\nAnother set of regulations in the proposal focuses on strengthening the financial balance of the social security system. The social security contribution rate for debt restructuring (excluding birth debt restructuring) will increase from 32% to 45%. Similarly, the reinstatement rate for Bağ-Kur and Agricultural Bağ-Kur insured individuals will rise from 34.75% to 45%. These adjustments are projected to bring in an additional 5.18 billion TRY annually.\n\nThe bill also grants the President the authority to increase the state contribution rate in the Individual Pension System (BES) from the current 30% up to 50%, or to reduce it to zero. Additionally, the net borrowing limit for 2025 is planned to be increased by 595 billion TRY, raising the total limit to 2 trillion 724 billion TRY.\n\n### Special Regulation for Mid-Black Sea Free Zone\n\nAn amendment to the Coastal Law will allow for the construction of industrial and commercial structures on the seaward side of the coastal line within the Mid-Black Sea Free Zone in Samsun Tekkeköy. This is projected to achieve 500 million dollars in annual exports and create 2,000 jobs upon full capacity utilization.\n\nLeasing Treasury lands is also expected to provide an additional 10 million dollars annually to the budget.\n\n### Tax Exemptions for YİKOB and UEFA Events\n\nThe proposal also includes certain exemptions for public institutions and international organizations. Vehicles registered under Investment Monitoring and Coordination Directorates (YİKOB) will be exempt from Motor Vehicle Tax. According to the impact analysis, this exemption will result in a symbolic revenue loss of only 4 million TRY. YİKOB properties will also receive VAT and title deed fee exemptions.\n\nFurthermore, deliveries and services related to the 2026 UEFA Europa League Final, the 2027 UEFA Conference League Final, and the 2032 European Football Championship, which Turkey will host, will be exempt from VAT. The revenue-reducing impact of this particular regulation is expected to be symbolic.",
