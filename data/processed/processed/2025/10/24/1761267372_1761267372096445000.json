  "content_md": "# Intel Returns to Profitability, Posts Strong Q3 Revenue Growth\n\n**Santa Clara, CA** â€“ Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) announced its third-quarter financial results for the July-September period, revealing a significant return to profitability and a 3% increase in revenue year-over-year, surpassing market expectations.\n\nThe chipmaking giant reported revenue of $13.7 billion for Q3, up from $13.3 billion in the same period last year. This performance marked a notable improvement for the company. Crucially, Intel reversed a substantial net loss from the previous year, reporting a net profit of $4.1 billion for the quarter, a stark contrast to the $16.6 billion net loss incurred in Q3 last year. Earnings per share (EPS) also saw a dramatic swing, moving from a $3.88 loss per share in Q3 2022 to a profit of $0.90 per share this quarter.\n\n## Strategic Progress and Balance Sheet Strengthening\n\nLip-Bu Tan, Intel's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), highlighted that the robust third-quarter financial outcomes underscore the company's improved performance and steady progress aligned with its strategic priorities.\n\nDavid Zinsner, Intel's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), emphasized the significant steps taken during the quarter to strengthen the company's balance sheet. These initiatives included accelerated funding from the U.S. government, alongside key investments from Nvidia and SoftBank Group. Zinsner noted that these investments have substantially enhanced Intel's operational flexibility.\n\n\"Our stronger-than-expected third-quarter results mark the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement, reflecting the fundamental strength of our core markets,\" Zinsner stated. He further added, \"Current demand is outpacing supply, a trend we anticipate will continue through 2026.\"\n\n## Key Investments and Partnerships\n\nIntel has secured substantial investments totaling billions of dollars in recent months:\n\n*   **U.S. Government Investment:** In August, Intel announced an agreement with the U.S. administration, revealing a planned $8.9 billion investment in the company's shares by the government.\n*   **SoftBank Group Investment:** Japan-based SoftBank Group also signed an agreement in August to invest $2 billion in Intel.\n*   **Nvidia Collaboration:** Last month, Nvidia announced a partnership with Intel to jointly develop specialized data center and personal computer products.\n\n## Pending SEC Consultation on Government Transactions\n\nIntel's statement also disclosed that the company consulted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the accounting treatment for transactions with the U.S. government. However, these consultations could not be finalized due to a federal government shutdown. The company cautioned that its third-quarter financial results might be subject to revision if SEC personnel ultimately hold a different view on the appropriate accounting treatment.",
